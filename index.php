    <h1>Use Case/Interaction Flow</h1>
    <h2>Use Case</h2>
        <p>
            When Steve gets sometime to himself he loves to watch all of his favorite shows. He loves the convenience of being
            able to have all of his favorite shows and movies saved in a tab for his everyday use. The price for going to the
            movie theater and the price of cable are too much for Steve. So he prefers Hulu where he can access a vast library
            of entertainment at a low cost, in the comfort of his own home.
